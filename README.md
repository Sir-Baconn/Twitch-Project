# Twitch Social
This web app provides a way for Twitch streamers and users to easily and hastily interact with every piece of media that streamers use. You can view your favorite streamer's latest and most popular YouTube videos, Twitter tweets, Twitch Clips, and Reddit posts, all in one service. Doing this provides an easy way for users to keep track of their favorite streamers' social media as well as makes it easier for streamers to promote themselves on these social media platforms.


On top of this, we provide a way for streamers to create a streaming schedule and show it to all their followers. We did this because a lot of users feel that a lot of the time they do not know when streamers are going to stream. 


Sometimes streamers place their schedules underneath their stream but this can always be changing or even outdated. With our Scheduler, we make it easy for streamers to produce and edit their weekly schedule in order for their viewers to always know **when** the next stream will air and **what** will be streamed.
